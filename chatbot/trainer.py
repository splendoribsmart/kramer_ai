Question: How many death certificates should I request?
Answers: Death certificates are typically needed for financial institutions and insurance companies. Simple estates with a few assets should request 2-4 death certificates. Complex estates with multiple assets should request 7-10 death certificates.

Question: Can I view my loved one?
Answers: Please view or see your loved one prior to us transferring your loved one into our care. Once we transfer your loved one into our care we are unable to offer any type of viewing or seeing your loved one. 

Question: How to apply for Social Security benefits?
Answers: The U.S. Social Security Administration (SSA) helps families in need by dispersing federally-funded funds to either a surviving spouse or child.  The one-time lump sum benefit amount is $255.  It is paid to a surviving spouse who was living in the decedent's household at the time of death, or, if living apart, was receiving social security benefits on the decedent's record. If there is no eligible spouse, the payment may go to a child who was eligible.

You can apply for this benefit by calling the Social Security National Toll-Free Service at 1-800-772-1213. You may also visit your local social security office. To expedite the process, you should be ready with these documents listed below:

- Death certificate
- Birth certificate or other proof of birth
- W-2 forms(s) and/or self-employment tax returns from the previous year
- Final divorce decree, if applying as a surviving divorced spouse; and
- Marriage certificate

To help you in determining your eligibility, please take the SSA's Benefit Eligibility Screening Tool.
At Kramer Family Funeral Home, we will assist you in notifying the Social Security Administration of your loved one's passing. We will be happy to answer any additional questions you may have.
